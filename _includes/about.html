      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>The USAID Knowledge Rescue initiative is a grassroots effort to preserve critical development knowledge, resources, and institutional memory that might otherwise be lost due to organizational changes and transitions.</p>
      <p>We believe that development knowledge belongs to the global community and should remain accessible to practitioners, researchers, and organizations working to create positive change around the world.</p>
      <p>Our community brings together development professionals, knowledge management experts, librarians, and advocates to collaboratively identify, rescue, and preserve valuable resources for future generations.</p>
